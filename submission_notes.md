**Some additional instructions**

- Each time I ran my NFC-RNAseq pipeline, I encountered timeouts due to OSC's restriction of a maximum runtime of 4 hours. Consequently, the results stored within the NFC-RNAseq directories remain incomplete. Please disregard these incomplete results. However, you have the option to rerun this pipeline if sufficient time limits are granted on OSC.

- Since I tried to run my dataset with two different pipeline, I have separate runner script for each of the pipeline (not what is required in guideline: "A single runner script1 that aims to rerun the full workflow").

- I realize I could have chosen clearer names for my pipelines. For clarity, I'll refer to the directory "/fs/ess/PAS2700/users/aryalb/project/pipeline" as Pipeline-I and the directory "/fs/ess/PAS2700/users/aryalb/project/nfc-rnaseq" as Pipeline-II. Thank you for your understanding.
